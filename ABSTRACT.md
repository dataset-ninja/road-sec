**ROAD-SEC** stands as an object detection dataset comprising 13221 images, featuring annotations belonging to a singular class - *road_element*. Captured by stationary security cameras, these images offer diverse perspectives of highways and roads. This dataset encompasses a wide array of road elements, including but not limited to cars, trucks, pedestrians, and various environmental conditions such as differing weather patterns and lighting scenarios. The diversity in elements and environmental variations within the dataset provides a rich resource for training models to detect and understand the complexities of road elements within varying conditions and situations, crucial for applications in traffic analysis, road safety, and surveillance systems.

The YOLO annotated dataset of highways and roads is a collection of images and corresponding annotation files that have been labeled using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm. The images in this dataset were captured by fixed security cameras and show different views of highways and roads. The dataset includes a variety of different elements, such as cars, trucks, and pedestrians, as well as different weather and lighting conditions. The annotations in the dataset provide detailed information about the objects in the images, including their location, size, and class. 

The dataset is designed to be used for training and testing computer vision algorithms and models, particularly those focused on object detection and classification in the context of highway and road security. The annotations in the dataset were carefully curated by human annotators, ensuring high-quality labeling and accurate object recognition. This dataset can be a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and engineers who are working on computer vision projects related to highway and road security, as well as those interested in the YOLO algorithm and object detection techniques.
